<p>An early Saturday morning is a seldom visited neighbour. It’s home every weekend and you plan to catch up. You’re always looking forward, excited about the rendezvous. Then you miss it. And it’s gone for a week. But, sometimes, you get to say a ‘Hi’. This was one of those days. The Sun was seeing the morning off, when heaving and huffing, I landed at the library. It was library, because my mind equated seeing the morning with lunacy. The glaze had already started hurting. So, I considered a sojourn. Inside, the building was empty. On another day, I wouldn’t have picked on a stray stack of newspapers, an unsolicited reader. Why, I have my own newspapers for company all the time.
But, since no one was about and I had no real purpose of hanging around the place at that time, I bent to look through the bundle.
<strong>“Stop it! Leave it there! Who told you to touch them? ”</strong>
Surprise, and then, a fit of amusement so took me over, that I simply scurried my way out.
If JEE has got to your head, I’d suggest you wait for an encounter with the staff in Roorkee, or arrange for one. These people have just the right antidote to bring you back to ground. Vanity is not too good too long.</p>

<p>P.S. It is on hearing of such episodes that I consider trading places with PC for the sheer joy of first-hand laughter and some serious stimulation for soul-searching to find out if we live in an Ivory Tower.</p>

<p><strong>From,</strong></p>
