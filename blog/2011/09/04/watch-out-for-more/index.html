	<div class="entry-content"><p>There comes a time in every person’s life when he is asked to bark like a dog in front of a few extraordinary gentlemen, his selection into their beloved organisation conditional on him performing said demeaning task. He can choose to swallow the ignominy in silence and leave the scene without making a fuss. Or he could accept the challenge as his forthcoming baptism by fire, and get ready to unleash the canine within him in all its guttural glory. Either way, he risks getting stuck with a life-long regret. On an eventful early August afternoon 6 semesters ago, some higher power decreed that I throw caution to the winds and bark my heart out. In a life characterised by idiocy and imprudence, that remains one of the wiser decisions I have ever made.</p>

<p>That is not to say that not being a part of WONA would have consigned my life to ruin and despair. Far from it- there were ways, from using this rejection to launch a rival magazine of my own (which in the company of a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1066671645&amp;ref=ts">good friend of mine</a>, who would be the brains behind it, would have probably overtaken the original in all but name by this time) to using all the free time to set alight the ghissing arena, obliterating academic records left, right and centre, and earning semester exchanges, foreign interns and a Presidential scholarship to boot for my pains. Ah, what a life that would have been. <em>Truly despicable and utterly loathsome, not to mention downright sickening and grotesque</em>- a tiny voice inside my head whispers.</p>

<p>3years, about a dozen issues (most of them printed), countless night-outs and so many incredible hours spent working with the lads and lasses later, I cannot even begin to imagine what it would have been like had I chosen the other pill. But as things turned out, here I am now- all geared up for any menial post-retirement obligations that might be thrown my way. Making some sort of modest contribution to the new and promising WONA blog seems to be the first of it. And true to the nature of those who engage themselves in the service of this great magazine, I am a good fortnight and more late in doing it.</p>

<p>Indeed, between lazing away all night long in front of our comps on the pretext of formatting and spending day time either sleeping or gallivanting with the mates, it is a miracle that we bring out a couple of issues every semester. Like a cash-strapped football club with a threadbare squad that somehow manages to avoid relegation on the last day of the season courtesy an injury-time goal by the striker who is set to leave, we manage to escape not bringing out the mag by the skin of our teeth every time. The disapproving frowns of dear seniors turn into reluctant smiles once they hold the published matter in their hands. We find our chagrin in the skeptical half of the campus, and delight in the appreciative half. And we never fail to promise in the end- <em>Watch Out for more!</em></p>

<p>Had he been dead, our founding father’s corpse would have turned in his grave looking at the levels of degradation that have crept into this news agency. Where once a pencil and a few charts of paper in the hands of a dedicated half dozen were all it took to bring out the “news-letter”, we are talking online news and Facebook publicity today. The concept of a blog was unheard of at the time of our inception more than 15 years ago; now, I can sprawl on my bed and post my views about the admin’s insanity up on the website, and remove the feature later if word of it reached one of the top dogs. Gone are the days of hand-made news pamphlets and notice-board snippets. Technology has made slothful asses out of us; people are now demanding campus news on a platter. They deserve a good measure of entertainment as well.</p>

<p>And that is what this blog will hopefully help achieve. Anything and everything related to the campus is welcome here- preferably with a dash of humour. Profound stuff is appreciated too, but will contribute lesser hits on the site than perhaps uploading lectures and tutorials would. I shall be posting once in a while, as will be my fellow pensioners. For those who can’t get enough of my deranged ravings, the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mannodiarun">greatest social networking site in the history of mankind</a> could be of some help. For others- well, if it’s any solace, I am hardly a man of my word and I will probably be taking more rides in the Dean’s car than I&#8217;ll be posting here. Regardless, watch this space.</p>
