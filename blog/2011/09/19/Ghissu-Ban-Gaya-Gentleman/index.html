	<div class="entry-content"><p>Not so long long ago was a man of great valour. A bastion of strength. A man with a  spirit to conquer the world. An astonishing urge to dominate the world. Stand what may come attitude bolstered by a unprecedented determination, flaring through the eyes. No one even lurked near him, such was his aura. After a worthy yet connoting introduction I present to you ladies and gentlemen the protagonist - GHISSU .</p>

<p>Ghissu was a boy of straight  A+s. He demoralized the professors (!) of his college by hitting a spot on, bulls eye, perfect 10 SGPA in the first semester. He had achieved this unique feat all thanks to the qualities described above.
Determined to take a revenge and turn tables, the professors connived to break him. To break his dream of perfect 10 cgpa. They succeeded narrowly. They managed to degrade his grade in one of the subjects to 9. That was it. The dream had shattered. The horizon became dark for Ghissu. A hush set upon his life. He pondered as to what had invited such a comeuppance. As Ghissu was reeling through the reverberations of the dreaded gradesheet the professors had a merry time  absorbing a feeling of satisfaction from the nearly impossible feat they had conjured up.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As the aftershocks of the result bypassed, he regurgitated the facts of his first semester. He had valour but only in the face of examinations-ready for head on collisions with the questions from the tutorial or the exercises from the textbook. He was a bastion of strength but only in the realms of academics. He didn’t have the spirit to conquer the world but the spirit to conquer handful of classmates that too through vomiting out mugged up notes and tutorials. He stood tall in the face of exams but faltered when a practical situation aroused. His eyes weren’t flaring determination but had become scanners for class notes, textbooks and tutorials. Nobody was near him, not because everyone feared him or respected him but because he had been a narcissist self-centred smug who kept on changing his radius of proximity with others according to his petty needs and expectations.</p>

<p>Finally he understood what he was and chuckled at himself for being distraught thinking that 9.8 was his problem when all along it was 10 that was the problem !</p>

<p>After this insightful finding he set out, to become a real ‘person’. In the past and even in contemporary times we have seen people travelling seven seas to the foothills of the Himalayas in search of the inner self, wasting decades in dedicated penance. But our Ghissu wanted results fast. So instead, he went out on a search for a brain transplant. He plodded through the corners of the world to satisfy his newfangled caprice. Finally he set his mind on a 5 pointer. This was the ideal mind to see the beautiful world around him, to follow mercurial paths of life rather than follow the mundane and now obnoxious routine of lectures and hostel timings.</p>

<p>After a 10 hour surgery he was ready.</p>

<p>Same old body but a racing mind which ‘really’ wanted to conquer the world.The mind was always working, noticing the small things around, reasoning, concluding- how the nature works and not how the CGPA system works. He remembered how his old mind had a kind of switch which went on only when he sat down to cram the piles of books in front of him. The new mind was instinctive, mercurial. Nobody was its master. Neither the teachers nor the parents not even the low grades could compel him to cut back and sit down and mug. Ghissu wondered how would his old mind have felt if he would have gone into an exam not solving the tutorials or the exercises. Just knowing the concepts but no practice at his disposal. It gave him chills down the spine. No solving of tutorials every alternate nights nor running in a frenzy to be first to submit the files. It was a relief. He had unplugged himself from the robotic life he had been living for the past years.</p>
