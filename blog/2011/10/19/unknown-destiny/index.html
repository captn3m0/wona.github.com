	<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday morning I had found my cycle punctured when I had already been running late to class by five minutes. Irked at my cycle&#8217;s betrayal, struck by the sudden realization that I had no time for an afternoon nap, having the accuser in me smirking at the guilty mulling over how nothing useful had transpired during the vacations, I was convinced that that was the best time for apocalypse. In fact, I was so convinced that I  removed the  otherwise pointless drawing sheet with very ugly views of die-casters, acting as a sun-shield, from my head, in a move to encounter whatever, head on. Stumbling feebly across the road, there was a puny little kid, who, in a series of serendipitous events, was evading being hit by vehicles honking and zooming past her.</p>

<p>She seemed too little to even stand firmly on her knees and as one would expect, the bystanders were too busy to care. I noticed, while crossing the road, how a few of them spared the wailing kid a benevolent smile and walked past very kindly. Minutes later, the mother, visibly shaken, came to collect the kid, seated on a small bunk in the security guard&#8217;s chamber inside KB and crying her eyes out.  I walked to the mess leaving this particularly voluble guard to enter into an expected soliloquy.</p>

<p>R, like all the other places in the world, has its lot of desolate and needy people. More than a year ago, I met an elderly man, bent with age, staggering along the corner of the street. As we walked back to where I presumed his house was, he spoke slowly of was and when and I politely nodded whenever he paused. Perhaps talking to someone who had no clue what he was saying was the closest he had got to a conversation, in days. I spotted the same old man walking alone months later. It was bitterly cold and a passerby, a godsend, offered him a ride when I had been looking around helplessly, holding him to provide balance.  Perhaps, I was thinking while having lunch, I could manage a few brilliant replies and even engage him in a lighthearted conversation in Hindi, if I see him around now. I chuckled at the bazinga.</p>

<p>I poked around the spoon in a plate of dal and rice, pensively for a while. One of the reasons, people- me , you and everyone, can&#8217;t be bothered with societal change, is that we believe there are &#8216;others&#8217; entitled to do it. If the kid had got under a car, it would have been most unfortunate. Surely, <em>someone</em> must have noticed her. Security guards and the callous mother are to blame. Given that the kid looked pitiful in rags and with snot on her nose, I wasn&#8217;t very excited when I picked her up. Besides, the world is full of mishaps. Misfortune turns around in a vicious cycle no one has the power to reason with or stop altogether.  And of course, hasn&#8217;t Rand asked us to immerse ourselves irreproachably deep in our own business ? Didn&#8217;t she say, altruism is nothing to be proud of and on the contrary, selfishness will make you a paragon of virtue? Never mind what she actually meant, never mind if the context was entirely different. After all, in a world where half the people thinking &#8216;Anna is India&#8217; haven&#8217;t read through the propositions of the lokpal bill, understanding weird philosophies isn&#8217;t a common trait . Everybody is a classy theorist on social issues. Giving a rupee to a child begging on the street is bad encouragement . Buying a candy from Aunty&#8217;s Burger shack is not very morally incorrect , but, what happens to a million other hungry children? There are other fascinating, tenable justifications that sprout out of the highly empirical mind.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason for nonchalance is, if the world&#8217;s providence is dictated by its karma, making post-apocalyptic plans doesn&#8217;t really seem inappropriate.</p>
