	<div class="entry-content"><p>If there is one human activity that&#8217;s older than human existence itself, it is (the art of) cribbing. Our ancestors, the venerable Amoebae vented out their frustration by dividing into two.  Millenniums later, in a parallel universe, Rene Descartes is rumoured to have said, &#8220;I crib, therefore I am&#8221;. And why else would a baby&#8217;s first home be a crib if not to prepare him for a lifetime filled with the same.</p>

<p>A recent survey[1] established that cribbing is the third most popular activity in IITR after,
1) Bugging seniors for chapos
2) A certain activity that takes place in the dark inside hostel rooms under sheets. (I was talking about sleeping, you sick pervert)
It is no secret that finding the words &#8216;satisfied&#8217;, &#8216;Roorkee&#8217; and &#8216;IITian&#8217; in the same sentence is as common as finding Salman Khan with a shirt on. But I digress from Salman Khan&#8217;s attire.</p>

<p>One of our favourite whineyards is the absence of good electives. Every semester before the endsems, IMG (now Campus Skunk) opens its floodgates exposing the naive R-ites to hitherto unheard of terms like Cosmetology, Snorkelling and <a href="http://entomology.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">Far side Entomology</a>. The experienced lot are forced to disown trivialities like interest and learning in favour of easy proxies, no backs and the absence of an 8AM class. I recollect <a href="http://wona.co.in/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=16&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=42" target="_blank">an article from my first year</a> in the moronic magazine, aptly titled &#8220;Hobson&#8217;s Choice: All roads lead to the earthquake department&#8221;. But no more! With the influx of many a young turk, the days of gerontocracy were over. The institute had final woken to the sound of the clarion. New electives with fancy names were floated by departments above the slope, and held in class rooms that were actually near Nesci. The times, they were a-changing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough was enough&#8221;, I came to a conclusion. &#8220;I am in an IIT to learn, and learn I will&#8221;. So I registered for one of those baroque, hard-to-pronounce electives offered by the MIT return. Four months later I enter my first class five minutes late, having missed 3 classes the previous week. Cold walls and the icy demeanour of 20-odd enthusiastic (read ghissu/muggu) juniors greet me. The young lecturer coolly informs me that I have missed five attendances as he had to take two extra classes the previous week, and a even a single case of absenteeism hence will result in my not being able to write the exams. &#8220;Oh and by the way, we have extra field trips too. Two hours every week in a field pulling strings to understand what String theory really is&#8221;, he added with glee. Any wise man in my situation would have decided to go on and take the bull by its horns. But that wise man was not I. And so I decided to throw the towel.</p>

<p>2 Days, 101 signatures and a few thousand applications later, I was one of the teeming millions in an elective offered by a department dealing with disasters. &#8220;But sir&#8221;, I argued. &#8220;How can anyone not appreciate the subtleties of Fire-Extinguising 101&#8217;. An argument that he could never refute thanks to generations of farzi* seniors who had populated the course and proven beyond doubt that Fire extinguishing was indeed every engineer&#8217;s ultimate fantasy.</p>

<p>My close encounters of the fourth kind had me thinking (mostly during class hours when I couldn&#8217;t be bothered to listen). Given that most of us have as much an idea about our future as Arnab Goswami has about shutting up, not to mention the delusions we seem to be harbouring, do we even need a choice? After all, isn&#8217;t the illusion of choice yet another exercise in futility till we realise that we don&#8217;t really have one. China, which forcibly united its provinces under one language and culture seems to be thriving enough to buy Greece whereas democratic India is floundering under the banner of disunity in perversity. Maybe we are better off with the blue pill, and without questioning whether or not it is air that we breathe.</p>

<p>Maybe, maybe Hobson&#8217;s choice is better than Sophie&#8217;s after all.</p>
