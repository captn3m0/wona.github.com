		<p>If there is one human activity that&#8217;s older than human existence itself, it is (the art of) cribbing. Our ancestors, the venerable Amoebae vented out their frustration by dividing into two.  Millenniums later, in a parallel universe, Rene Descartes is rumoured to have said, &#8220;I crib, therefore I am&#8221;. And why else would a baby&#8217;s first home be a crib if not to prepare him for a lifetime filled with the same.</p>

<p>A recent survey[1] established that cribbing is the third most popular activity in IITR after,
1) Bugging seniors for chapos
2) A certain activity that takes place in the dark inside hostel rooms under sheets. (I was talking about sleeping, you sick pervert)
It is no secret that finding the words &#8216;satisfied&#8217;, &#8216;Roorkee&#8217; and &#8216;IITian&#8217; in the same sentence is as common as finding Salman Khan with a shirt on. But I digress from Salman Khan&#8217;s attire.</p>

<p>One of our favourite whineyards is the absence of good electives. Every semester before the endsems, IMG (now Campus Skunk) opens its floodgates exposing the naive R-ites to hitherto unheard of terms like Cosmetology, Snorkelling and <a href="http://entomology.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">Far side Entomology</a>. The experienced lot are forced to disown trivialities like interest and learning in favour of easy proxies, no backs and the absence of an 8AM class. I recollect <a href="http://wona.co.in/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=16&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=42" target="_blank">an article from my first year</a> in the moronic magazine, aptly titled &#8220;Hobson&#8217;s Choice: All roads lead to the earthquake department&#8221;. But no more! With the influx of many a young turk, the days of gerontocracy were over. The institute had final woken to the sound of the clarion. New electives with fancy names were floated by departments above the slope, and held in class rooms that were actually near Nesci. The times, they were a-changing.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There comes a time in the life of every website, when in the face of alarmingly infrequent updates, positively atrocious coding skills, characteristically low creativity, staggeringly low hits, and pretty much, lack of anything else to do, one is forced to resort to extreme measures - Put up pictures of naked chicks on the website. Unfortunately, this brilliant idea was vetoed by all the other members of the team. So, we present to you the next best thing – the WONA blog. All the news, views, reviews that you never wanted to read in the first place, are now available on one website, so that not reading them has never been easier. It gets better- this time around, the WONA blog is open to all.</p>

<p>So, whether you’re in the mood for a little Monday morning rant, or a Ayn Randesque post about life, the insti and everything, or whether that google search for ‘random funny blogs about hostel life by authors not very fussy about copyright infringement’ finally gave a valid result or you’re just plain jobless, you know that WONA’s loyal readers (yes, all three of them) will religiously follow your every post, and spam the comments section.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above corny lines, there’s only so much creativity in this world, and most of it is in other people.</p>

<p>P.S. Appreciative comments are welcome.</p>

<p>P.P.S. Unappreciative comments are also welcome but will only be redirected to the recycle bin.</p>
