		<p>Not so long long ago was a man of great valour. A bastion of strength. A man with a  spirit to conquer the world. An astonishing urge to dominate the world. Stand what may come attitude bolstered by a unprecedented determination, flaring through the eyes. No one even lurked near him, such was his aura. After a worthy yet connoting introduction I present to you ladies and gentlemen the protagonist - GHISSU .</p>

<p>Ghissu was a boy of straight  A+s. He demoralized the professors (!) of his college by hitting a spot on, bulls eye, perfect 10 SGPA in the first semester. He had achieved this unique feat all thanks to the qualities described above.
Determined to take a revenge and turn tables, the professors connived to break him. To break his dream of perfect 10 cgpa. They succeeded narrowly. They managed to degrade his grade in one of the subjects to 9. That was it. The dream had shattered. The horizon became dark for Ghissu. A hush set upon his life. He pondered as to what had invited such a comeuppance. As Ghissu was reeling through the reverberations of the dreaded gradesheet the professors had a merry time  absorbing a feeling of satisfaction from the nearly impossible feat they had conjured up.</p>

		<p>There comes a time in every person’s life when he is asked to bark like a dog in front of a few extraordinary gentlemen, his selection into their beloved organisation conditional on him performing said demeaning task. He can choose to swallow the ignominy in silence and leave the scene without making a fuss. Or he could accept the challenge as his forthcoming baptism by fire, and get ready to unleash the canine within him in all its guttural glory. Either way, he risks getting stuck with a life-long regret. On an eventful early August afternoon 6 semesters ago, some higher power decreed that I throw caution to the winds and bark my heart out. In a life characterised by idiocy and imprudence, that remains one of the wiser decisions I have ever made.</p>

<p>That is not to say that not being a part of WONA would have consigned my life to ruin and despair. Far from it- there were ways, from using this rejection to launch a rival magazine of my own (which in the company of a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1066671645&amp;ref=ts">good friend of mine</a>, who would be the brains behind it, would have probably overtaken the original in all but name by this time) to using all the free time to set alight the ghissing arena, obliterating academic records left, right and centre, and earning semester exchanges, foreign interns and a Presidential scholarship to boot for my pains. Ah, what a life that would have been. <em>Truly despicable and utterly loathsome, not to mention downright sickening and grotesque</em>- a tiny voice inside my head whispers.</p>

		<p>I swear,
“I never was the purple cow
I only got to see some
But I can tell you anyhow
I’d rather be than see one”</p>

<p>An early Saturday morning is a seldom visited neighbour. It’s home every weekend and you plan to catch up. You’re always looking forward, excited about the rendezvous. Then you miss it. And it’s gone for a week. But, sometimes, you get to say a ‘Hi’. This was one of those days. The Sun was seeing the morning off, when heaving and huffing, I landed at the library. It was library, because my mind equated seeing the morning with lunacy. The glaze had already started hurting. So, I considered a sojourn. Inside, the building was empty. On another day, I wouldn’t have picked on a stray stack of newspapers, an unsolicited reader. Why, I have my own newspapers for company all the time.
But, since no one was about and I had no real purpose of hanging around the place at that time, I bent to look through the bundle.
<strong>“Stop it! Leave it there! Who told you to touch them? ”</strong>
Surprise, and then, a fit of amusement so took me over, that I simply scurried my way out.
If JEE has got to your head, I’d suggest you wait for an encounter with the staff in Roorkee, or arrange for one. These people have just the right antidote to bring you back to ground. Vanity is not too good too long.</p>

<p>P.S. It is on hearing of such episodes that I consider trading places with PC for the sheer joy of first-hand laughter and some serious stimulation for soul-searching to find out if we live in an Ivory Tower.</p>

<p><strong>From,</strong></p>

<p>Mrinal Tripathi,
Chemical III year.</p>

		<p>If there is one human activity that&#8217;s older than human existence itself, it is (the art of) cribbing. Our ancestors, the venerable Amoebae vented out their frustration by dividing into two.  Millenniums later, in a parallel universe, Rene Descartes is rumoured to have said, &#8220;I crib, therefore I am&#8221;. And why else would a baby&#8217;s first home be a crib if not to prepare him for a lifetime filled with the same.</p>

<p>A recent survey[1] established that cribbing is the third most popular activity in IITR after,
1) Bugging seniors for chapos
2) A certain activity that takes place in the dark inside hostel rooms under sheets. (I was talking about sleeping, you sick pervert)
It is no secret that finding the words &#8216;satisfied&#8217;, &#8216;Roorkee&#8217; and &#8216;IITian&#8217; in the same sentence is as common as finding Salman Khan with a shirt on. But I digress from Salman Khan&#8217;s attire.</p>

<p>One of our favourite whineyards is the absence of good electives. Every semester before the endsems, IMG (now Campus Skunk) opens its floodgates exposing the naive R-ites to hitherto unheard of terms like Cosmetology, Snorkelling and <a href="http://entomology.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">Far side Entomology</a>. The experienced lot are forced to disown trivialities like interest and learning in favour of easy proxies, no backs and the absence of an 8AM class. I recollect <a href="http://wona.co.in/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=16&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=42" target="_blank">an article from my first year</a> in the moronic magazine, aptly titled &#8220;Hobson&#8217;s Choice: All roads lead to the earthquake department&#8221;. But no more! With the influx of many a young turk, the days of gerontocracy were over. The institute had final woken to the sound of the clarion. New electives with fancy names were floated by departments above the slope, and held in class rooms that were actually near Nesci. The times, they were a-changing.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There comes a time in the life of every website, when in the face of alarmingly infrequent updates, positively atrocious coding skills, characteristically low creativity, staggeringly low hits, and pretty much, lack of anything else to do, one is forced to resort to extreme measures - Put up pictures of naked chicks on the website. Unfortunately, this brilliant idea was vetoed by all the other members of the team. So, we present to you the next best thing – the WONA blog. All the news, views, reviews that you never wanted to read in the first place, are now available on one website, so that not reading them has never been easier. It gets better- this time around, the WONA blog is open to all.</p>

<p>So, whether you’re in the mood for a little Monday morning rant, or a Ayn Randesque post about life, the insti and everything, or whether that google search for ‘random funny blogs about hostel life by authors not very fussy about copyright infringement’ finally gave a valid result or you’re just plain jobless, you know that WONA’s loyal readers (yes, all three of them) will religiously follow your every post, and spam the comments section.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above corny lines, there’s only so much creativity in this world, and most of it is in other people.</p>

<p>P.S. Appreciative comments are welcome.</p>

<p>P.P.S. Unappreciative comments are also welcome but will only be redirected to the recycle bin.</p>
