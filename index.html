		<p>“An educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false, misleading, fictitious, mendacious - just dead wrong. “
Russel</p>

<p>B.Tech in Pulp and Paper Engineering, the brochure reads. Placements have been good in this field in the recent years. And as a small aside- the course is run in Saharanpur Campus, 50 km from Roorkee. The descriptions of  Polymer Science and Technology and Process Engineering with MBA, run along the same lines.
Every year, groups of students who clear the JEE, but only just,grab this course along their only path to become an IITian. Sacrificing the chance to learn their favorite courses at rather less reputed institutions, they put all their faith in the hallowed name of IIT, sometimes leaving their homes thousands of kilometers behind. Alas! Fate is cruel to them- they get a rude shock soon after arriving to take their place in the halls of their dreams. Nothing in their worst nightmares could have prepared them for the mental distress which plagues everyone in this institute. Isolated from their classmates, unrecognized as IITians even by the shopkeepers nearby, they are soon struck by the realization that this was certainly not what they signed up for, and definitely not what they deserved.</p>

<p>Soon plagued by the contagious depression that infects this campus,they start feeling imprisoned.
IIT should be a place that gives wings to our dreams, where we can take flight and discover newer realms of success. This naive description of an IIT might be for several other students who cleared the prestigious JEE, but the 500 unfortunate students who set their feet in IIT Roorkee&#8217;s Saharanpur campus can never truly agree with it. This  continued crushing of dreams has an adverse effect on almost every student. Those who are unable to survive this find their escape in intoxicating substances while others just resign themselves to their fate.</p>

<p>But a few optimistic ones decided to put up a fight. Over the years there have been several organised protests and petitions to improve or shift this departmentto Roorkee. Each time, the students were placated by promises and proposals, which we do not deny did improve the campus in general- however it never did manage to address the basic feeling- that we are not a part of IIT Roorkee. Last year, the director, in a meeting,said that it would be a good proposal to shift the undergradaute courses to Roorkee, turning the saharanpur campus into a research institute. As the students got to know of this, they launched an organised and constitutional movement to get what is increasingly being dubbed as “the campus shift”. However the director, at a meeting with student representatives later, insisted that his comment had been off- the-cuff and not serious. After a mass student sit-in at roorkee was fenced off with diplomatic statements and sweet words, the movement petered off.
This year, a new batch of students arrived, which within one month became deeply dissatisfied.The hunger strike was begun by them to demand a campus shift and was joined by several seniors whose spirits had not been crushed by their repeated failures.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The summers are always long. No matters how good a family you got, or how much money to spend; they do at some point or other start boring you. The point is everybody starts looking out for unconventional ways of killing time.
I am 21, single, with no interest left in my education. I am miserable. Therefore my drive to find crazy ways to kill my time is much stronger than the rest of the population. One such way is dirt biking. I usually take my bike out in the morning or late evenings and set off to far off villages. Well most of these villages are not electrified, neither does any of them has roads laid out. I believe that these villages can be developed as great dirt biking locations, although I am not pretty much certain that they are fit enough for human settlement. During one such expedition I came face to face with what movie analysts would call dark comedy.</p>

<p>There is this hamlet called Haidurganj on the Gorakhpur-Basti highway. This Muslim dominated locality is exactly like the dozen other villages spread across the highway, except for the fact that it has a mosque which is more magnificent than any other you would find in entire Gorakhpur. The floor is entirely laid with high quality marble. The marble was specially imported from Rajasthan for the construction of the mosque. There is brilliant calligraphy done on the inner side of the dome wall. It would make Steve Jobs proud.  Rahman Chacha tells me those are verses from the Quran. He knows the best. He did it.</p>

<p>However it’s not the mosque which brought me to this village.</p>

<p>One evening while trading with speed I saw a huge crowd encircling a farm tractor. It seemed that the entire village had suddenly developed a reverence for that vehicle. Actually it was Azlaan Shah, an octogenarian from the village, who needed some serious medical attention. He had been ill for quite some time now. He was being carried to the medical college. I noticed something peculiar about the direction in which the tractor left.</p>

<p>It went in the direction opposite to that in which the Gorakhpur Medical College was located.</p>

<p>So were the villagers really tired of Azlaan and wanted him dead? On further inquiry a few people present around told me that the vehicle had left for the medical college. That either meant there were two medical colleges, or I was wrong. I had full faith in my knowledge and more so in the government’s inability to open two medical colleges in the same district. Armed with conviction I went to the only source of reliable information I had, Rahman Chacha. What he told forms the crux of the story.</p>

<p>The facilities available at the state run Gorakhpur Medical College are so unreliable and the treatment so costly that the villagers had lost all trust. The only option they had was to rush the patient to the capital, PGI Lucknow. Such was the state of affairs that the villagers had actually named the Basti-Lucknow stretch of the highway as the Medical College Road. To supplement my dose of enlightenment Rahman took me to a village tour. Characteristic of any eastern UP village there were a large number of rice fields all around. After every half kilometer the crop seemed to be greener, denser and thicker. It appeared as if those five by five stretches were better nourished.</p>

<p>Rahman had an explanation for this.</p>

<p>According to the village custom the dead were supposed to be buried in their field. After the burial was done that five by five stretch of land was cemented and a stone raised in the honor of the dead. The stone had a few verses from the Quran along with the name of the dead. This should be done when a villager dies. The cementing prevented any further growth of vegetation on that stretch and rice plants would make their way along the boundary of the grave stone.</p>

<p>In this village the grave was dig as soon as the village folks knew that an elderly was ill.</p>

<p>The villagers knew that the guy would be dead before he could reach Lucknow. A six hour journey was asking too much from the patient. Mourning would invariably start once family members saw first signs of critical illness. The Gorakhpur Medical College was a half an hour ride nobody undertook.</p>

<p>There is always a twist in the tale.</p>

<p>Some disobedient fellows time and again manage to escape death. They were brought back to the village amidst great fanfare. What happened to the five by five stretch of land?</p>

<p>During irrigation the dug up part of land had a lot more water accumulated in it, than the adjoining areas. Water retention being the key behind a good harvest, the crop there would be thicker.
It was not extra nourishment through Urea, rather the unused grave which brought about the surplus harvest. The harvest one year, Rahman tells me, was so good that the Panchayat even considered applying for the “Ideal Village Award”.</p>

<p>That was my last visit to Haidurgunj, perhaps I was disgusted, and maybe I lacked courage. I would never know what happened with the grave of Azlaan.</p>

<p>Peepli Live may not be fiction. Look around.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Our institute takes a rather ambiguous stance on the attendance shortage rule. While technically, a student should be forced to repeat a course if his attendance falls below that magical 75% mark, this dictum seldom comes into play owing to general leniency shown by professors and departments. Unless the figure under consideration has reached unspeakably abysmal levels, in which case the student probably knows what’s coming. Regardless of the course or professor or department in question, students generally breathe easy if they are somewhere near the 65 to 70% mark.</p>

<p>This myth was shattered in one fell swoop by the pride of the Metallurgy department on Friday the 18th of November, when a certain senior professor decided to unleash his full fury upon unsuspecting final year students who had naught on their minds but graduating out of this institute in 6 months time without any major incident. That was not to be, for they are being debarred from sitting for one particular exam because their attendance is below some limit the prof dreamed up in his spare time.</p>

		<p>You told me to observe and learn from everything that happened around me. That way you said I would grow up to be an intelligent man. But of late it feels I have seen enough. Every new thing is not exactly new. Every event differs from its predecessor in the mode in which it occurs. The underlying sentiments somehow seem to be the same everywhere. I want to share something with you.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday morning I had found my cycle punctured when I had already been running late to class by five minutes. Irked at my cycle&#8217;s betrayal, struck by the sudden realization that I had no time for an afternoon nap, having the accuser in me smirking at the guilty mulling over how nothing useful had transpired during the vacations, I was convinced that that was the best time for apocalypse. In fact, I was so convinced that I  removed the  otherwise pointless drawing sheet with very ugly views of die-casters, acting as a sun-shield, from my head, in a move to encounter whatever, head on. Stumbling feebly across the road, there was a puny little kid, who, in a series of serendipitous events, was evading being hit by vehicles honking and zooming past her.</p>

<p>She seemed too little to even stand firmly on her knees and as one would expect, the bystanders were too busy to care. I noticed, while crossing the road, how a few of them spared the wailing kid a benevolent smile and walked past very kindly. Minutes later, the mother, visibly shaken, came to collect the kid, seated on a small bunk in the security guard&#8217;s chamber inside KB and crying her eyes out.  I walked to the mess leaving this particularly voluble guard to enter into an expected soliloquy.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Roorkee</strong> The day when his fellow inmates were hailing the newly operational 1 Gbps internet by putting up status updates on the social networking site Facebook, a 3rd year B. Tech student at Radhakrishnan Bhawan, IIT Roorkee created an uproar in his hostel wing by putting up a controversial status.</p>

<p>The student, Peter Parker is an occupant of a posh Cautley-facing room on the seventh floor of the highrise. When this floor became the first to get &#8216;sarkari&#8217; internet access amongst all the floors of the Bhawan, students blissfully logged in to their Facebook accounts to break this news to every nook-and-corner of the world. They posted congratulatory messages while those with Twitter accounts tweeted this development to Chetan Bhagat.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Parker, instead of going with the flow, updated his Facebook status as &#8220;RKB murdabad!!&#8221;. As soon as this status went online, it flared up tensions in the nearby rooms on the seventh floor. Patriotic students forcibly took him out of his room and administered him a generous GPL amidst slogans like &#8220;Inquilaab Zindabaad!!&#8221; and &#8220;Anna Hazare amar rahe!!&#8221;. As this news-flash trickled down the floors of the Bhawan, more inmates joined the commotion, resulting in a 400 people-strong mob. The grand open-for-all GPL ceremony continued for another 20 minutes when a mysterious sage-like old man came out of nowhere, appealed for peace, and disappeared. Suddenly, there was calm, and it appeared as if the students had been influenced by the hermit&#8217;s aura. Afterwards no untoward incidents were reported. Later some students argued he was none other than the Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, who had tried to guise himself in a Batman robe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the IIT Roorkee administration is contemplating to slap a 10-marks discipline fine on the accused (victim) student.</p>

		<p>Not so long long ago was a man of great valour. A bastion of strength. A man with a  spirit to conquer the world. An astonishing urge to dominate the world. Stand what may come attitude bolstered by a unprecedented determination, flaring through the eyes. No one even lurked near him, such was his aura. After a worthy yet connoting introduction I present to you ladies and gentlemen the protagonist - GHISSU .</p>

<p>Ghissu was a boy of straight  A+s. He demoralized the professors (!) of his college by hitting a spot on, bulls eye, perfect 10 SGPA in the first semester. He had achieved this unique feat all thanks to the qualities described above.
Determined to take a revenge and turn tables, the professors connived to break him. To break his dream of perfect 10 cgpa. They succeeded narrowly. They managed to degrade his grade in one of the subjects to 9. That was it. The dream had shattered. The horizon became dark for Ghissu. A hush set upon his life. He pondered as to what had invited such a comeuppance. As Ghissu was reeling through the reverberations of the dreaded gradesheet the professors had a merry time  absorbing a feeling of satisfaction from the nearly impossible feat they had conjured up.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There comes a time in every person’s life when he is asked to bark like a dog in front of a few extraordinary gentlemen, his selection into their beloved organisation conditional on him performing said demeaning task. He can choose to swallow the ignominy in silence and leave the scene without making a fuss. Or he could accept the challenge as his forthcoming baptism by fire, and get ready to unleash the canine within him in all its guttural glory. Either way, he risks getting stuck with a life-long regret. On an eventful early August afternoon 6 semesters ago, some higher power decreed that I throw caution to the winds and bark my heart out. In a life characterised by idiocy and imprudence, that remains one of the wiser decisions I have ever made.</p>

<p>That is not to say that not being a part of WONA would have consigned my life to ruin and despair. Far from it- there were ways, from using this rejection to launch a rival magazine of my own (which in the company of a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1066671645&amp;ref=ts">good friend of mine</a>, who would be the brains behind it, would have probably overtaken the original in all but name by this time) to using all the free time to set alight the ghissing arena, obliterating academic records left, right and centre, and earning semester exchanges, foreign interns and a Presidential scholarship to boot for my pains. Ah, what a life that would have been. <em>Truly despicable and utterly loathsome, not to mention downright sickening and grotesque</em>- a tiny voice inside my head whispers.</p>

		<p>I swear,
“I never was the purple cow
I only got to see some
But I can tell you anyhow
I’d rather be than see one”</p>

<p>An early Saturday morning is a seldom visited neighbour. It’s home every weekend and you plan to catch up. You’re always looking forward, excited about the rendezvous. Then you miss it. And it’s gone for a week. But, sometimes, you get to say a ‘Hi’. This was one of those days. The Sun was seeing the morning off, when heaving and huffing, I landed at the library. It was library, because my mind equated seeing the morning with lunacy. The glaze had already started hurting. So, I considered a sojourn. Inside, the building was empty. On another day, I wouldn’t have picked on a stray stack of newspapers, an unsolicited reader. Why, I have my own newspapers for company all the time.
But, since no one was about and I had no real purpose of hanging around the place at that time, I bent to look through the bundle.
<strong>“Stop it! Leave it there! Who told you to touch them? ”</strong>
Surprise, and then, a fit of amusement so took me over, that I simply scurried my way out.
If JEE has got to your head, I’d suggest you wait for an encounter with the staff in Roorkee, or arrange for one. These people have just the right antidote to bring you back to ground. Vanity is not too good too long.</p>

<p>P.S. It is on hearing of such episodes that I consider trading places with PC for the sheer joy of first-hand laughter and some serious stimulation for soul-searching to find out if we live in an Ivory Tower.</p>

		<p>If there is one human activity that&#8217;s older than human existence itself, it is (the art of) cribbing. Our ancestors, the venerable Amoebae vented out their frustration by dividing into two.  Millenniums later, in a parallel universe, Rene Descartes is rumoured to have said, &#8220;I crib, therefore I am&#8221;. And why else would a baby&#8217;s first home be a crib if not to prepare him for a lifetime filled with the same.</p>

<p>A recent survey[1] established that cribbing is the third most popular activity in IITR after,
1) Bugging seniors for chapos
2) A certain activity that takes place in the dark inside hostel rooms under sheets. (I was talking about sleeping, you sick pervert)
It is no secret that finding the words &#8216;satisfied&#8217;, &#8216;Roorkee&#8217; and &#8216;IITian&#8217; in the same sentence is as common as finding Salman Khan with a shirt on. But I digress from Salman Khan&#8217;s attire.</p>

<p>One of our favourite whineyards is the absence of good electives. Every semester before the endsems, IMG (now Campus Skunk) opens its floodgates exposing the naive R-ites to hitherto unheard of terms like Cosmetology, Snorkelling and <a href="http://entomology.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">Far side Entomology</a>. The experienced lot are forced to disown trivialities like interest and learning in favour of easy proxies, no backs and the absence of an 8AM class. I recollect <a href="http://wona.co.in/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=16&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=42" target="_blank">an article from my first year</a> in the moronic magazine, aptly titled &#8220;Hobson&#8217;s Choice: All roads lead to the earthquake department&#8221;. But no more! With the influx of many a young turk, the days of gerontocracy were over. The institute had final woken to the sound of the clarion. New electives with fancy names were floated by departments above the slope, and held in class rooms that were actually near Nesci. The times, they were a-changing.</p>
